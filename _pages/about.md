I am a Ph.D candidate in American Politics and Political Methodogy in the [Department of Political Science](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/political-science/) and a Graduate Research Affiliate in the [Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/csdi/)  at [Vanderbilt University](http://vanderbilt.edu/). I graduated *magna cum laude* from the [University of California, Los Angeles](http://ucla.edu/) with a B.A. in Political Science. In March 2023, I was a [Democracy Center Visiting Scholar](https://www.sas.rochester.edu/democracycenter/research/visiting-scholars.html) at the University of Rochester.

My research focuses on the relationships between campaign positioning, electoral competition, and campaign finance in congressional elections, with a particular emphasis on primary races. In my dissertation project, I leverage original data on House primary candidatesâ€™ positions to investigate how election dynamics and (sub)constituencies shape campaign positions, and whether these positions provide meaningful signals about future legislative behavior. My other solo and co-authored work uses causal inference tools, experiments, and structural estimation to evaluate the determinants and effects of money in congressional elections.

I am originally from Portland, Oregon and my free time is mostly spent traveling, cooking, writing amateur restaurant reviews, and volunteering at my local Planned Parenthood.
