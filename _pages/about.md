I am a postdoctoral associate in the [Center for the Study of American Politics](https://csap.yale.edu/) at Yale University. In 2025, I will join Yale's [Department of Political Science](https://politicalscience.yale.edu/) as an Assistant Professor. I received my Ph.D. from the [Department of Political Science at Vanderbilt University](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/political-science/), where I was affiliated with the [Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/csdi/). Previously, I was a [Democracy Center Visiting Scholar at the University of Rochester](https://www.sas.rochester.edu/democracycenter/research/visiting-scholars.html) and earned my B.A. in the [Political Science Department at UCLA](https://polisci.ucla.edu/). 

My research centers on the U.S. Congress, money in politics, electoral campaigns, and political organizations. Much of this work investigates the interplay between candidates' self-presentations and financial contributorsâ€™ strategies in congressional campaigns, with an emphasis on primary elections. Broadly, I combine original data, natural language processing, causal inference tools, experiments, and structural estimation of formal models to further our understanding of strategic interactions among political elites.
