I am an incoming postdoctoral associate in the [Center for the Study of American Politics](https://csap.yale.edu/) at [Yale University] and will be joining Yale's [Department of Political Science](https://politicalscience.yale.edu/) as an Assistant Professor in 2025. I received my Ph.D. from the [Department of Political Science](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/political-science/) at [Vanderbilt University](http://vanderbilt.edu/), where I was affiliated with the [Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/csdi/). Previously, I was a [Democracy Center Visiting Scholar](https://www.sas.rochester.edu/democracycenter/research/visiting-scholars.html) at the University of Rochester and earned my B.A. in Political Science from [UCLA](http://ucla.edu/). 

My research centers on the U.S. Congress, money in politics, electoral campaigns, and political organizations. Much of this work investigates the interplay between candidates' self-presentations and financial contributorsâ€™ strategies in congressional campaigns, with an emphasis on primary elections. Broadly, I combine original data, natural language processing, causal inference tools, experiments, and structural estimation of formal models to further our understanding of strategic interactions among political elites.
