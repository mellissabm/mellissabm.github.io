Interacting with students has been one of the highlights of my time in graduate school. In addition to helping undergraduates in my capacity as a teaching assistant for a variety of substantive and methodological courses, I have had the immense privilege of working with students who assist me with my own research. 

While TAing data science courses, numerous students inquired about research opportunities to further hone their skills and gain hands-on experience. Since 2021, I have trained and managed over a dozen exceptional undergraduates to help me collect original data for my dissertation project. Hearing my RAs' perspectives on the data and project has been invaluable to my research.

If you are a current Vanderbilt undergraduate who is interested in congressional elections, considering graduate school in political science or a related field, or otherwise wishing to gain hands-on experience with research and data collection, you may inquire about research assistant opportunities by emailing me at [mellissa.b.meisels@vanderbilt.edu](mailto:mellissa.b.meisels@vanderbilt.edu).
